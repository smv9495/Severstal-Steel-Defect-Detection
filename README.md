# Severstal-Steel-Defect-Detection

A deep learning project to predict and locate defect type in given steel sample images

## 1. Business Problem

Steel is one of the most important building materials of modern times. Steel buildings are resistant to natural and man-made wear which has made the material ubiquitous around the world. To help make production of steel more efficient, this competition will help identify defects.

Severstal is leading the charge in efficient steel mining and production. They believe the future of metallurgy requires development across the economic, ecological, and social aspects of the industry and they take corporate responsibility seriously. The company recently created the country’s largest industrial data lake, with petabytes of data that were previously discarded. Severstal is now looking to machine learning to improve automation, increase efficiency, and maintain high quality in their production.

The production process of flat sheet steel is especially delicate. From heating and rolling, to drying and cutting, several machines touch flat steel by the time it’s ready to ship. Today, Severstal uses images from high frequency cameras to power a defect detection algorithm.

In this competition, you’ll help engineers improve the algorithm by localizing and classifying surface defects on a steel sheet.

If successful, you’ll help keep manufacturing standards for steel high and enable Severstal to continue their innovation, leading to a stronger, more efficient world all around us.

## 2. Mapping to DL problem

Given steel sample images, our task is to:
  - Predict whether defect is present or not
    - If defect is present:
      - Classify the sample as defective  
      - Predict defect type
      - Locate the defect
    - If defect is not present:
      - Classify the sample as not defective
